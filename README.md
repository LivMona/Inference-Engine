# Inference-Engine - COS30019 - Assignment 2 - 2020

### About
Program containing a Inference Engine using propositional logic based on Truth Table (TT) checking, and Backward Chaining (BC) and Forward Chaining (FC) algorithms. 
Your inference engine will take as arguments a Horn-form Knowledge Base and a query which is a proposition symbol and determine whether the query can be entailed from Knowledge Base.

### Test mode
Testing mode is disabled by default. To enable it change the following variable to true:
- Inference Engine > testMode;
  - When enabled, will loop through all methods
- Methods.java > testMode;
  - When enabled, counts how many iterations it takes to find a solution.
